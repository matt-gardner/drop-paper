\begin{itemize}
    \item Question type distribution. We curate most frequently occurring top 200 bi-gram and tri-gram patterns and partition them into different categories based on domain knowledge. For example, the patterns with words ``longest", ``shortest"", and farthest etc. would require sorting.
   This heuristic-based approximate question distribution is shown in \figref{answer_distrib}
    \item types of reasoning needed to answer questions \tabref{interesting_example}
    \item distribution of answer types - span, number, digit
    \item What's \emph{not} in the data: common sense inference, except for lexical relationships (e.g., grandfather $==$ mother's father).  Some questions require knowledge of scoring in sports; there are enough examples of these that the model at least has a chance of learning this from the data.
