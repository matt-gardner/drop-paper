    \item Motivation - Predicate argument structure were developed in order to capture "meaning" of a sentence / proxy for information extraction, + brief discussion on the representation we experimented with.
    \item Predicate-argument structure representation.
    \item example.
    \item query language (mention that it's similar to other query languages).
    \item context representation.
    \item Model used 
    \item hyperparameters (tree depth,...)
