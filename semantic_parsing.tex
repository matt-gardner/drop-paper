Semantic parsing \cite{semantic-parsing}
deals with translating a natural language utterance to
an executable formal lanugage.
This paradigm was shown to particularly lend itself to constrained question-answering
over domain-specific datasets, such as geography (e.g., GeoQuery \cite{geoquery})
@@, or more recently @@ \gabi{more examples}.

In our setting, we will use sentence representation formalisms which were
developed with the goal of capturing meaning in open-domain text, to match \drop's
open-ended questions over from diverse domains,
for which traditional semantic parsing formalisms may not be expressive enough.
Specifically, we will experiment with three prominent formalisms, each
representing different semantic granularity level:
(1) syntactic dependencies \cite{sd}, which captures word-level relations, 
(2) Open Information Extraction (Open IE; \cite{oie}), a shallow
form of semantic representation, which links predicates
with their arguments, abstracting away certain syntactic variations, and
(3) Semantic Role Labeling (SRL; \cite{srl}), which can be seen as an
augmentation of Open IE with predicate sense disambiguation and finer, predicate-specific
argument roles.
