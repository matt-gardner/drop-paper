TODO- GABI

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Look at the dev part, and come up with QA templates
  *which can be automatically detected*.
\item
  Assess their frequency on the dev set. How much of it do the chosen templates cover.
  (maybe this can be a part of the analysis section?)
\item
  Come up with heuristics for each QA template, probably based on frequencies in
  the dev set.
  How well do they do?
\end{itemize}
